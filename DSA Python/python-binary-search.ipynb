    "## How to Run the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn the material is to execute the code and experiment with it yourself. This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This notebook is made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "## Why You Should Learn Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're pursuing a career in software development or data science, it's almost certain that you'll be asked to solve programming problems like *reversing a linked list* or *balancing a binary tree* in a technical interview or coding assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's well known, however, that you will almost never face these problems in your job as a software developer. So it's reasonable to wonder why such problems are asked in interviews and coding assessments. Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can **think about a problem systematically** and solve it systematically step-by-step.\n",
    "- You can **envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases** for programs you write.\n",
    "- You can **communicate your ideas clearly** to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions.\n",
    "- Most importantly, you can **convert your thoughts and ideas into working code** that's also readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not your knowledge of specific data structures or algorithms that's tested in an interview, but your approach towards the problem. You may fail to solve the problem and still clear the interview or vice versa. In this course, you will learn the skills to both solve problems and clear interviews successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course takes a coding-focused approach towards learning. In each notebook, we'll focus on solving one problem, and learn the right techniques, algorithms, and data structures to come up with an *efficient* solution to the problem. We will also discuss how the technique can be applied to solve other similar problems.\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, focus on solving the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **QUESTION 1:** Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mazym6s.png\" width=\"480\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like a simple problem, especially if you're familiar with the concept of _binary search_, but the strategy and technique we learning here will be widely applicable, and we'll soon use it to solve harder problems."

    "## The Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reading the problem, you may get some ideas on how to solve it and your first instinct might be to start writing code. This, however, is not the optimal strategy, and you may end up spending a far longer time trying to solve the problem than you might anticipate, or you may not be able to solve it at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n",
    "2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n",
    "3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.\n",
    "4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.\n",
    "5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.\n",
    "6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Applying the right technique\" is where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms comes in handy. \n",

    "\n",
    "You will often encounter detailed word problems in coding challenges and interviews. The first step is to state the problem clearly and precisely in abstract terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, for instance, we can represent the sequence of cards as a list of numbers. Turning over a specific card is equivalent to accessing the value of the number at the corresponding position the list. The problem can now be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "> We need to write a program to find the position of a given number in a list of numbers arranged in decreasing order. We also need to minimize the number of times we access elements from the list.\n",

    "#### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cards`: A list of numbers sorted in decreasing order. E.g. `[13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0]`\n",
    "2. `query`: A number, whose position in the array is to be determined. E.g. `7`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `position`: The position of `query` in the list `cards`. E.g. `3` in the above case (counting from `0`)\n",
